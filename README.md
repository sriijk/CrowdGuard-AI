# üõ°Ô∏è CrowdGuard AI  
**An AI-Powered Real-Time Crowd Monitoring and Overcrowding Alert System Using YOLOv8 and Heatmap-Based Zone Analysis**

---

## üìå Project Summary

CrowdGuard AI is a real-time crowd monitoring and safety system designed to detect overcrowded zones in public areas using a combination of deep learning and zone-based spatial analysis. It uses **YOLOv8** for object detection and applies **heatmap-based zone logic** to trigger alerts when crowd density exceeds safe thresholds.

This system is especially beneficial for event organizers, public safety officials, and emergency response teams to preemptively manage dangerous crowd situations.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Prevent crowd disasters by early detection of overcrowded zones
- Provide zone-wise visualization for better crowd management
- Allow deployment in real-time settings like schools, religious events, festivals, and stadiums
- Offer alerting mechanisms (sound, visual) for high-risk detection
- Provide trend tracking via graphs and heatmap evolution

---

## üîç What It Does

- üé• Accepts **webcam input** or **uploaded video**
- üß† Detects people using **YOLOv8 Nano model**
- üß± Applies **3x3 zone grid overlay** on each frame
- üî• Calculates live and cumulative heatmaps for density monitoring
- üìà Plots real-time graphs showing crowd evolution over time
- üö® Triggers **audio alerts** and visual warnings when zones are overcrowded
- üìÑ Logs timestamped alerts and zone values in CSV for analysis

---

## üñºÔ∏è Key Features

- ‚úÖ YOLOv8-powered real-time people detection
- ‚úÖ Grid-based zone analysis (3x3 matrix)
- ‚úÖ Heatmap rendering: last frame, cumulative, average
- ‚úÖ Real-time overcrowding alert (sound + color zone highlight)
- ‚úÖ Upload `.mp4` or use webcam directly
- ‚úÖ Log file export of alert history
- ‚úÖ Crowd density line chart with timestamp
- ‚úÖ Customizable light/dark UI theme with responsive layout

## üìö YOLOv8 Model Info

- Model used: [`yolov8n.pt`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Download link:
  ```
  wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt
  ```
- Trained on COCO dataset
- Lightweight (ideal for real-time edge deployment)

> You may substitute with `yolov8s.pt`, `yolov8m.pt`, or custom-trained model based on deployment needs.

---

## üß™ Sample Output

**Detected Zones with Alert:**
```
[ 2  1  4 ]
[ 0  8  2 ]
[ 1  3  1 ]
```
> This means Zone 5 (center) has a high density (alert triggered).

---

## üìä Real-Time Graphs

- üìà X-axis: Frame number or timestamp  
- üìâ Y-axis: Total people detected or per-zone count  
- Line chart automatically updates with each frame

---

## üîä Sound Alert Logic

- Beep triggers if any zone exceeds a configurable threshold (default: 5)
- Zone with highest crowd density is highlighted in red
- Audio alert plays from the browser (Replit-supported)

---

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

- üïå Religious festivals with massive crowd gathering
- üèüÔ∏è Sports stadiums & concerts
- üõçÔ∏è Malls, metro stations, and transit hubs
- üè´ School/university events
- üö® Protest sites or public demonstrations

## üåê Why Replit for Deployment?

Unlike most cloud platforms (Render, Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face), Replit:

- ‚úÖ Supports webcam access inside browser  
- ‚úÖ Supports sound alerts through media files  
- ‚úÖ Runs both backend (OpenCV + YOLO) and frontend in one space  

This makes Replit ideal for demoing all features of **CrowdGuard AI** without stripping any functionality.
